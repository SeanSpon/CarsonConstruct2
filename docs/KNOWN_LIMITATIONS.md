# Known Limitations

These are current MVP limitations to align expectations.

- Drag-and-drop intake accepts `.mp4` and `.mov` only. Use the file picker for other formats.
- Auto Edit preview is a placeholder; there is no in-app before/after playback yet.
- AI enhancement requires a configured OpenAI API key; without it, results are algorithm-only.
- Exports depend on FFmpeg being available in the system PATH.
- No batch processing or social publishing workflows are shipped in the MVP.
