# ClipBot MVP Rules

## The One Rule That Matters

**If a clip does not tell a complete story, it does not ship.**

This is not a suggestion. This is the product.

---

## What ClipBot REFUSES To Do

1. **Ship incomplete stories** — No random quotes, no "good moments" without context
2. **Override quality gates** — No "force export" buttons, no manual rescue
3. **Prioritize volume over quality** — Fewer clips is a valid (good) outcome
4. **Let humans edit clips** — If you need to edit, the system failed upstream
5. **Ship low-confidence clips** — Below 60% confidence = DROP

## The 4 Quality Gates

Every clip must pass ALL FOUR gates. Fail any one = DROP.

### Gate 1: Narrative Completeness
- Must have at least 2 of 3 story elements:
  - **Setup** (context, question, claim)
  - **Core** (explanation, tension, insight)
  - **Resolution** (takeaway, conclusion)
- If < 2 elements → DROP

### Gate 2: Visual Continuity
- Clean start and end points
- No mid-word cuts
- Duration: 15-90 seconds
- Speech ratio: ≥ 70%

### Gate 3: Caption Clarity
- Minimum 15 words
- Complete sentences (not cut off)
- Understandable when muted

### Gate 4: Confidence Threshold
- AI confidence ≥ 60%
- Context dependency ≤ 70%
- System must be confident this is shippable

## Human Actions (The ONLY Allowed Ones)

### ✅ Allowed
- ⭐ Star/Favorite
- 👍 Approve
- 👎 Reject
- "More like this" feedback

### ❌ NOT Allowed
- Timeline editing
- Caption rewriting
- Manual clip rescue
- Force export
- Override quality gates

**Expected human time per episode: 2-5 minutes**

If you're spending more time, the system is failing.

---

## Output Standards

### Per Episode
- 5-10 story-complete clips
- Vertical 9:16 format
- Platform-ready (TikTok/Instagram)
- Clean captions
- Confidence labels: 🔥 Top Pick / 👍 Solid / 🧪 Optional

### What It Should Feel Like
> "A really good editor who just happens to be fast."

---

## Rejection Is Success

When clips are dropped, it means:
- The quality gates are working
- Brand safety is protected
- Only shippable content survives

**An empty output is a valid result.**

Better to ship nothing than to ship slop.

---

## Technical Authority

- **Backend is source of truth** — UI obeys backend decisions
- **If backend says DROP** — UI cannot revive it
- **No exceptions** — Rules are rules

---

## The Positioning

Clients pay $3k/month for:
- ✅ Taste
- ✅ Consistency
- ✅ Trust
- ✅ No embarrassment

NOT for:
- ❌ AI novelty
- ❌ Volume
- ❌ Automation flex

**This is premium production, not factory output.**
